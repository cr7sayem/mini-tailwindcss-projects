Tailwind CSS Mini Projects
Welcome to my repository of Tailwind CSS mini projects! These projects are part of my journey to learn and experiment with Tailwind CSS as I tip my toe into this amazing utility-first CSS framework.

About
This repository contains mini-projects that I have built while following Brad Traversy's tutorials. Brad Traversy is a well-known educator in the web development community, and his resources have been instrumental in helping me understand the fundamentals of Tailwind CSS.

Each project here demonstrates a specific concept or feature of Tailwind CSS, helping me gain hands-on experience with the framework.

Note: The designs and code for these projects closely follow Brad Traversy's tutorials as I am in the process of learning and building foundational skills.
